# PyCharter
This program can simulate a Part 91/135 Charter operation.
Users will add aircraft to a database, submit bids, and then log the flights they complete.
The program tracks flight times, block times, aircraft locations, and aircraft maintenance discrepencies. 

In the future, this program will have a GUI or Web Interface rather than running via the command line.
